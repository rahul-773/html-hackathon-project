        <p>Once you've built your HTML project, the next step is to deploy it so that others can access it online. Here are some simple steps to help you deploy your first HTML project:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Choose a Hosting Platform:</strong> There are several free and paid hosting platforms available. Some popular options include GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, and Firebase Hosting. For beginners, GitHub Pages is a great choice as it's free and easy to use.</li>
            <li><strong>Create a Repository (for GitHub Pages):</strong> If you're using GitHub Pages, start by creating a new repository on GitHub. Name it appropriately, for example, "my-first-html-project".</li>
            <li><strong>Upload Your Files:</strong> Upload your HTML files (and any associated CSS or JavaScript files) to the repository. You can do this by dragging and dropping the files into the repository on GitHub or by using Git commands if you're familiar with Git.</li>
            <li><strong>Enable GitHub Pages:</strong> Go to the repository settings, scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section, and select the branch you want to use (usually "main" or "master"). Then click "Save". Your site will be published at `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name`.</li>
            <li><strong>Test Your Website:</strong> Open the URL provided by GitHub Pages in your web browser to see your deployed website. Make sure everything looks good and functions as expected.</li>
            <li><strong>Share Your Website:</strong> Share the URL of your deployed website with friends, family, or anyone you want to show your work to!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Congratulations! You've successfully deployed your first HTML project. As you continue learning and building more complex projects, you'll become more comfortable with deployment and may explore other hosting options as well.</p>
